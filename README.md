# Practicing-EDA---Pokemon-Task
Analzying Pokemon data using EDA method 
In this task the senario is that you’re a budding data analyst and your dream company, PokeStack, is hiring data analysts. PokeStack is a company focusing on the research of Pokemon.

You apply for a role and you’re pleased because they’ve gotten back to you with a technical assignment to assess your skills (similar to what you can expect in the real world). 

In Part 2, the other senario is an inter-company Generation 1 Pokemon competition is coming up soon and your company will be participating in it. Through secret channels, your manager has learnt that the Pokemon that your company will be fighting against is Jolteon.

With this knowledge, your manager has tasked you with finding a Pokemon that is best suited for battle against it. As pokemons have different strengths and weaknesses, a good pokemon for battle against Jolteon is one where its strength is Jolteon’s weakness.

For analyzing and comparing Pokemon skills, I use https://www.theloadout.com/pokemon-type-chart website to determine what Jolteon weak to some skill.
